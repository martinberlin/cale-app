**A very easy and straight-forward E-Ink Screen configurator**

Calendar Low Energy is a dynamic way to organize content from different sources including weather, todo lists and any applications that expose an open API.
The Firmware is easy to install, free and open source

### What it can be used for

1. Meeting room sign that updates every hour showing next meetings and attendees
2. Living picture, showing events or Cloudwatch statistics
3. Help screens at the side of your laptop, refreshing dynamic information every 10 minutes
4. Any other application you may find interesting to see in real-time outside the monitor

This Android application will let you configure your CALE device in an easy way using Bluetooth low energy BLE. So you can tell the
ESP32 your WiFi Credentials and the URL of your Screens.
The idea is that you can copy / paste one JSON text from [CALE.es](https://cale.es) and with this single action,
the ESP32 will save the configuration and be ready to connect to your WiFi and render your Screen after restarting.
